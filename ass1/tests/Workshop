that most
courses will run with no casual teaching assistance. Yes, this has been =

for some courses already (e.g. specialised courses with small =

from next year it will be true for a much wider range of courses.

We'll be running a workshop to discuss how to keep achieving good =

outcomes, but with less reliance on casual teaching ...

When:   Thursday 1st December, 12noon-4pm
Where:  K17 Level 1 Seminar Room

*Lunch* will be provided by the School. Please RSVP to this email for =

Richard Buckland, Ashesh Mahidadia, Eric Martin and I have already =

they'd like to share, please let us know.

We look forward to seeing you at a productive session on Thursday, jas

Hi John,

I would really like to attend as I'm involved in 3 courses next year 
with significant lab components.
Unfortunately, I've already scheduled 2 Co-op presentations at Atlassian 
on Thursday arvo, which I am now trying to re-schedule. If I can't 
manage that, I won't be able to stay for long.

Cheers,
Oliver

Here's my impression of the plan at the end of today's discussion =85

Structure the workshop around the activities that we do in teaching a =
course,
and how we might adjust each of these activities.

Go activity-by-activity and present (a) current practice, (b) ideas that =
we have
either tried (evaluated?) or are considering trying.

My first cut at a list of activities =85

* lectures
* tutorials (theory exercises/clarification)
* labs (practical exercises)
* assignments/projects
* portfolios
* assessment/marking (tied in with the above four)
* forums (on-line interaction with students)
* consultations (live interaction with students)
* exams

What have I missed? Are these the right ones, anyway?

Does not seem you have missed anything.
Maybe I had in mind more specific topics/case studies, that in my case =
could sound as follows:

- Mastering the key concepts of the week with weekly quizzes: doing it =
efficiently
- A very lean and powerful programming environment to make everyone =
comfortable and productive in 2 or 3 labs
- Automatic assessment of style for promoting good practice as opposed =
to time-consuming manual annotation deemed to be ignored

Then I would have assigned these case studies to broader categories. =
"Delivering the material" (more general than "lectures"), "Assessment" =
sound like possible categories, whereas "portfolios" suitably extended =
sound more like another case study.

And then we could have topics of discussion such as "Exams" that are =
important but are not likely to  have enough meat for a case study.

the list looks pretty good john.  do you want to include activities like =
class presentations, peer reviewing each other's work, reflective =
journals (these could just be treated like assignments i guess tho they =
can have the nature of being assessed continuously by the tutor rather =
than just at the end.

sorry i'm so flat out with 1917 now, it looks like you had a productive =
meeting yesterday.  i'll be back online once the dust has settled today =
- let me know if there is anything in particular you want me to do at or =
prepare for the session in advance.  one thing i'd quite like to do is =
talk about portfolios from 1917/1927 as a case study of moving time from =
tutors to students.

cheers,
richard

Hi John,

I intend coming to the workshop, but I'm going to a Google developer day =
in the morning, so I probably will be late in getting to the workshop.

Cheers,

Ken

Ok =85 taking on board what Eric and Richard said, how about the =
following structure?

Content Delivery: ways of making sure students have access to concepts =
to be learned
 - includes live lectures, video lectures, text books, etc. etc.

Reinforcement: ways of ensuring that students understand the concepts
- includes: tutorials, labs, weekly quizzes, assignments, class =
presentations, etc. etc.

Reflection: ways of making students think about what they've learned
- includes: reflective journals (blogs), portfolios, feedback on =
assignments, peer review, etc. etc.

Assessment: checking that students really did learn it
- includes: quizzes, exams, etc. etc.

(The above four aspects lead to the acronym C.R.R.A. =85 it might be =
interesting angle for
one that looks more like C.R.A.P. :-)

These all need to be tied back to how much time is spent on them =85 =
currently (including
especially casual hours) =85 and how much time might be spent on them.

Not all of the above can be tied back to casual hours (e.g. lectures and =
texts =85 although
some people *do* use casuals to deliver lectures =85)

We could give the above as an intro and then present one or more case =
studies tied to
each topic.

=46rom the sound of what some people have been saying to me, they're =
expecting us all to
stand up and give presentations on what we do in our courses, and then =
discuss things,
which isn't quite what we're planning =85

Do we need some intro notes/comments? Who wants to give them?

I think it would handy if we had a Wiki up during the discussion =
(Richard?) and could type
ideas into it as we go =85

Sounds good, but note that quizzes are in both Reinforcement and =
Assessment, which is a bit problematic (will we manage to talk about =
them by separating clearly both functions?).

I would say it is a bit that...

I think we should spend almost no time on the intro and as quickly as =

nice one john!

just a wording thing: "assessment" tends to be used for both what is =
listed below as "Reinforcement" (formative assessment) and "Assessment" =
(summative assessment)

we should probably steer clear of using a common word which has =
different meanings in the minds of different people if we want to be =
really clear how about

Content Delivery

and

Accreditation or Certification

if we use "Accreditation" we get to keep the CRAP structure which i must =
say is very nice.

as you probably know open learning moves workload around by =
distinguishing between "R" and "A" types of assessment and noticing that =
only "A" type needs to be=20
invigilated by paid employees and "R" can be crowd sourced or automated =
with simplified demands for security.

re wiki - ok i'll set up a wiki page for us on OL so everyone can also =
have discussion there afterwards.

re people's expectations - i think it should be a workshop with =
practical outcomes for those who attend so a list of suggestions, =
perhaps written by us as we go or perhaps
prepared in advance - should be what we finish with and then have =
discussion around that.  not sure how long it is booked to go for but if =
it has a long booking i suggest=20
we finish early which i reckon makes people happy and more receptive to =
the session when they think about it afterwards.

see you shortly

regards
richard

i reckon support (sort of) falls into the same category as =
reinforcement.  ie activities which help them understand the content =
which has been delivered.

thats a very good point eric and i think it is really important that we =
teachers have a clear objective when we use things like quizzes and that =
we not muddle objectives together as research is pretty clear that once =
an assessment activity acquires a summative effect the formative effect =
is seriously impaired or even nullified. we need to bring this out =
clearly at the session.

yes i think your nice structure john can be filled in by us doing =

yes quickly is good as the audience may well be quite skeptical, tho i =
guess extreme cases may just not attend.

but i do think we need to give an overview and not just make it a tips =
session.  teaching design should be top down not bottom up.  perhaps we =
could start with 15 minutes outlining the different roles and objectives =
of the activities staff and tutors engage in and making the educational =
objectives for these activities explicit. =20

i think this is important as i suspect some teachers just replicate the =
assessment structures they themselves had a students without thinking =
about what they are trying to achieve with the same rigour and =
thoughtfulness that they might say apply to their research.

but once pointed out they can use their scholarly and creative / =
analytic skills to come up with effective and perhaps unexpected =
solutions.

I asked Morri yesterday what he wanted by way of follow-up to the =
Workshop (which, btw, he thought
went very well).

He said that an expanded version of the Wiki page, giving more details =
about what we've done and
links to online examples that people can look at, would be good.

Also, having other people who've done clever things put details of what =
they've done on the same
Wiki page would be useful.

So, Richard, could you set up read/write access to the Wiki page and let =
us know how to access it?

Thanks, jas

Times when I'm available:

Monday after 3.30
Tuesday before 3.00
Wednesday before 1.00
Thursday before 12.00

Suggestions for a time/place to meet?

If you can't make Tuesday, then we'll take the above into account.

If you want to send a few more details, especially how this is going to =
help
reduce the amount of casual teaching required, that'll make it easier to
incorporate into our coherent picture.

hi guys sorry for being cryptic before - am in looooong meeting being =
naughty sneaking off emails occasionally.

tomorrow i'm setting up for the day-of-lectures-and-tutes on wednesday.  =
i'll spend all day on it and even that won't be enough i fear so no =
chance of me doing anything else tomorrow (tuesday).

> If you want to send a few more details, especially how this is going =

the idea is to run all tute as labs essentially, this means no pay for =
tutor prep.
for 1927 say it's a saving of 1 hour for the first tute, none for repeat =
tutes.
so for a standard tutor teaching 2 tutes its 6 hours pw rather than 7 =
i.e. a 14%
saving, it also permits larger lab classes - making the move from 16->18 =
possible
without a drop in quality (that's the idea anyway, evidence so far looks =
good but
i'll gather more over summer 1927) =20

(marking stays the same at about 1hr/student).

basically the ideas are about how to run larger classes with less =
marking yet still
get the students a quality time by using community wherever possible =
instead of/
augmenting tutors.

cheers,
richard

Ashesh, Eric, John and Richard,

would you be able to lead a workshop on teaching practices in CSE some =
time in the next two weeks (I know John is away from 3 Dec so before =
then would be good).
The idea would be to invite everyone in the CSE to share their teaching =
practices which might lead to efficiencies.
The outcome that I expect is a document (that need not be very long) =
outlining some of the things that people have tried (and in which =
courses) which can then be used for people to think about what they =
might do next year before entering their course requirements.

If this is ok with you, I suggest you discuss a suitable date among you =
and then email the School. Lunch will be provided to encourage people to =
attend.

Thanks very much,
Morri.

If "thursday and friday" means Dec 1 and 2, that's fine with me.

There's a TC meeting on the Friday?

Ashesh wrote:

Some possibilities:

* Thu 12-3.30  (intro session 12-1, lunch 1-1.30, main stuff 1.30-3.30)
   (so Ashesh only misses the intro)

* Thu 1-4 (start with lunch ...)

* Fri 10-1 (followed by lunch and TC meeting)

Other suggestions? Preferences?

I guess Thurs 12 to 3:30pm would be more suitable to the participants,
I will try to come before 1pm anyway (have CRC conference up to 12noon
in the city).

I'm not sure when you were planning to have a session on how me might be =

have any input,
please don't schedule it after December 2 (remember that I'm being =

John,

results are due on 22 Nov so within the next week of that it would be =
good to organise a session
with some other CSE academics. The idea I had in mind is for people to =
share their experiences and
put together a report outlining various approaches/ideas with pointers =
to the courses that have implemented them.
Richard also approached me about sharing some ideas on how what he has =
been doing and Ashesh might also be
good in terms of his approach to tutes and assignments in ENGG1800.
Perhaps the three of you could lead the discussion with interested =
academics with a view to getting something written up before you head =
off on leave?
We can provide lunch as an incentive.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Morri.

Definitely. I've experienced Richard's approach as a tutor in 11s1, and =
Ashesh has chatted to
me about what he's doing.

Richard's OpenLearning has some nice ideas BUT there's no way I would =
consider it as a way
of achieving outcomes with less resources. He is lucky that he attracts =
a small army of rabidly
enthusiastic volunteers. It won't work for anyone who doesn't have that =
=85 unless he's changed
it a lot.

Sounds good.

I'd include Eric in this as someone to present ideas, as he has done a =
lot of work setting up
an interesting environment for COMP9021.

Arthur also has some novel ideas.

Flagging some dates to avoid:

Thu 24 Nov =85 Co-op scholarship interviews
Wed 30 Nov =85 Supp Exams

Are you going to pick a date and announce it?
