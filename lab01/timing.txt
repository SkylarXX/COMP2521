comments:
1.The performance of sorting is quite stable.
2.Generally,the time used for sorting reverse number lists is quicker than sorting
the random and sorted one, since reverse number lists only need to put the next 
data before the head of the linked list, which is able to save time that used for 
search the whole linked list.
3.In conclusion, its quite time consuming to sort the linked list via IntList.c. 
The reason for that might be the algorithm of IntList.c is much more 
complicated than the algorithm for sorting command.
